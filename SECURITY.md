If you believe you have found a security issue in this project, please report it as soon as possible.
You can open a GitHub issue labeled `security` or email the maintainers at [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com).

## Supported Release Lifecycle
We support only the latest major version of Theme Parks Atlas. When a new major version
is released, the previous major version will continue to receive security fixes for
six months. Users should upgrade to the most recent release to remain protected.
